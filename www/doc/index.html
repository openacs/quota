QUOTA PACKAGE

This package allow to control the number of files and the disk space
used by users and communities. For this we need to add a checkpoint in
the file "file-add.tcl" of the filestorage package (see below).
(Warning: At this stage, quota only works with web uploads, no webdav, 
because we have not add any checkpoint at that module. If you add 
that checkpoint, report to us.)

The site-admin is who manage the quota policy, accessing from contol
panel of any course with the package instancied, and it consists of:

     Set maximum quota value allowed:
        MaxQuotaByCommunity: Maximum quota by community in KB.
        MaxQuotaByUser: Maximum quota by user in KB.
        MaxQuotaByUserFolder: Maximum quota by user folder in KB.
        MaxFilesByCommunity: Maximun number of files by community.
        MaxFilesByUser: Maximun number of files by user.
        MaxFilesByUserFolder: Maximun number of files by comunity.
     Create personalized quotes to users and communities.
     De/Activate quota control (entire site, by community or by user)

If a community has not instancied the package by the course admin, it
use default parameters values. If site-admin create a personalized quota
for it, the package will be instancied automatically for this community.

When a community has instancied the package studens/members can access
to page with information of his detailed quota, and course-admin have
another page with the state community quota. 

At quota control we diference two cases: 
     Space used at Personal Folder: If the user don't exceed its
personal folder quota he will upload files.
     Space used at Communities by users: If the user don't exceed its
and the community quota he will upload files.
